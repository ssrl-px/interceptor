07.19.2022 - Collector bypass and json/string option

- Added option for workers to send results directly to UI
- Added option for workers to forward data in string format to either UI or collector
- CAUTION: can send data in JSON or string format to either UI or collector; collector
is prepared for that, but if UI isn't, can cause problems
