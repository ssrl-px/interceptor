07.02.2020 - staff-level config capability

This branch makes is possible for beamline staff to customize the configuration of the
Interceptor using beamline- or facility-specific config files that can be located
anywhere.

Features:

1. Config filepath command-line options
    - only the startup.cfg (or equivalent) path to be specified; processing.cfg to be
    included in startup.cfg
    - removed all host / port / ui, etc. command-line args
    - changed connector_run_mpi.py to reflect this

2. Script to generate default config files in desired location

3. Generating startup options from config file parameters

4. Optional reading of custom Eiger header keys that carry per-image processing commands

5. Output config (in startup.cfg) that allows staff to craft beamline-specific output
strings
    - hardcoded result string for now
    - read output and assemble output string from provided keywords, with specified
    delimiter
    - include checking for values in brackets

Other changes:

1. Streamlined config files
    - combined beamlines.cfg and ui.cfg into startup.cfg, added relevant settings
    - replaced experiments.cfg with processing.cfg

2. Different way to read config files
    - moved configparser code to separate read_config() function
    - can call that from packagefinder or separately (if filepath is provided)
